              	<p>A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your computer or other electronic devices from a website and is stored on your device's hard drive when you visit that website. There are different types of cookies which are used to do different things. These include letting you navigate between different pages on a website efficiently, remembering preferences you have given and helping us to identify ways to improve your overall site experience. Others are used to provide you with advertising which is more tailored to your interests or to measure the number of site visits and the most popular pages users visit. Cookies cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>

Persistent cookies can be used to retain user preferences for a particular website, allowing those preferences to be used in future browsing sessions.</p>

              	<p>We and our partners (such as Google) do store cookies in your browser. These enable us to remember your preferences and settings and accurately gather aggregate, anonymised data about how our website and apps are used.

              		<li>compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future.

This postcode never leaves your device, and is not transmitted back to the website/app operators or developers. Similarly, if you choose to enable location services in the Helpers app, your location will first be ‘fuzzed’ and offset, before being transmitted to the Helpers servers. Once on the Wolfmatrix Limited servers, this obfuscated location will be automatically deleted as soon as your results have been returned.</p>
