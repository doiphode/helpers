There are different types of cookies which are used to do different things. These include letting you navigate between different pages on a website efficiently, remembering preferences you have given and helping us to identify ways to improve your overall site experience. Others are used to provide you with advertising which is more tailored to your interests or to measure the number of site visits and the most popular pages users visit. Cookies cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>\n\n              \t<p>Generally, there are two different types of browser cookie, session cookies which are stored in the computer's memory during a user's browsing session and are automatically deleted from your computer when the browser is closed or the session is deemed to have ended; and persistent cookies which are stored on the user's computer and are not deleted when the browser is closed. Persistent cookies can be used to retain user preferences for a particular website, allowing those preferences to be used in future browsing sessions.</p>\n\n              \t<p>We and our partners (such as Google) do store cookies in your browser. These enable us to remember your preferences and settings and accurately gather aggregate, anonymised data about how our website and apps are used. For example, we use cookies to detect whether you’ve visited our website before, and remember information you may have previously provided us with, such as postcode. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>\n\n              \t<p>We use cookies and beacons to:</p>\n              \t<ul>\n              \t\t<li>understand and save user's preferences for future visits; and</li>\n              \t\t<li>compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted third-party services that track this information on our behalf. All event data captured by Google Analytics is automatically deleted after 14 months.</li>\n              \t</ul>\n\n              \t<p>The cookies and beacons utilised in the Helpers app and site are all first party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies which is where a small amount of text is stored in a user's computer which is created by the website that the user is visiting). Users may opt out of receiving app and website functionality reliant on Google Analytics by following instructions on the Google website. Users may also use cookie-blocking browser extensions such as UBlock, AdBlock, or Ghostery.</p>\n\n              \t<h4 class=\"contenth4\">How to control and delete cookies</h4>\n              \t<p>If you wish to restrict or block the cookies which are set by our website you can do this through your browser settings. The 'help' function within your browser should tell you how. Alternatively, you may wish to visit www.aboutcookies.org which contains comprehensive information on how to control and delete cookies.</p>\n\n              \t<p>Please be aware that restricting cookies may impact on the functionality of our website.

This means that they are responsible managing and protecting it. They do not at this time process any personal data in relation to the use of Helpers. Furthermore, they have no plans to do.</p>\n\n              \t<p>The Helpers app and website may request your postcode from time to time in order to deliver you with relevant local content. This postcode never leaves your device, and is not transmitted back to the website/app operators or developers. Similarly, if you choose to enable location services in the Helpers app, your location will first be ‘fuzzed’ and offset, before being transmitted to the Helpers servers. Once on the Wolfmatrix Limited servers, this obfuscated location will be automatically deleted as soon as your results have been returned.</p>\n\n              \t<h4 class=\"contenth4\">How we protect your data</h4>\n              \t<p>Wolfmatrix Limited take the security of your data seriously. No personal data leaves your device through the Helpers app. In any event, both the operators and developers of the app have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information they work with online in order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure to connected systems.</p>\n\n              \t<p>Information on Helpers usage is only made available to Wolfmatrix Limited in an aggregate and anonymised format. This means that we only get a summary of information on Helpers usage and cannot monitor individual users.</p>\n\n              \t<h4 class=\"contenth4\">Management of your data</h4>\n\n              \t<p>Responsibility for managing Helpers app data rests within Wolfmatrix Limited. They conform to the General Data Protection Regulations and cannot access any personal data on you.</p>\n\n              \t<p>As app usage data is only stored in aggregate format it may be impossible to delete individual users’ records as these are not identifiable (https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7667196?hl=en)</p>\n\n              \t<h4 class=\"contenth4\">What if I do not want my information used by Helpers app?</h4>\n              \t<p>If somebody else has physical access to your device, they may be able to identify you from the information you enter in-app. Wolfmatrix Limited collected some data (first name, last name, email, phone, postcode or hospital name) to serve you the required information. This data can be asked to remove from our server anytime you wish by emailing us on info@helpournhs.com. </p>\n\n        \t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"contenth4\">Changes</h4>\n        \t\t\t\t<p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace this Policy at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t        <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised policy. If you do not agree to the new policy, please stop using the Service. You are advised to review this policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"contenth4\">Other</h4>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The Service uses the NHS API(s), therefore by using the Service, you are subject to the NHS Privacy Policy. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Where data is collected by Google Analytics, it is done so under Google’s Analytics Data Processing Terms, and under clause 10 of the terms (accessible at https://privacy.google.com/businesses/processorterms/. All processing by third parties will be done in accordance with the Privacy Shield frameworks they have established.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Data collected provides anonymised insight into user usage of Helpers as well as performance issues, bugs, and crashes which may occur from time-to-time. This anonymised data is used to improve Helpers and prioritise new and existing content that is recognised as of interest to the app’s audience as a whole. Individual users cannot be identified from this information alone.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"contenth4\">Contact Us</h4>\n\t\t\t\t<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at info@helpournhs.com subject ‘Privacy Policy’.</p>\n\n          \t</div>\n\n        </ion-col>\n      </ion-row>\n    </ion-grid>\n\n</ion-content>\n");
